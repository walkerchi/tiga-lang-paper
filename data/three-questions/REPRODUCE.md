# Three-question experiments — 2026-09-19

This artifact is a local technical-report experiment, not a release benchmark.
No result exceeds 1B edges; the existing nine-run 1B archive is reused unchanged.
All new performance runs are forward-only. No benchmark GPU processes overlap.
Existing voice services remain running on both hosts.

## Environment

- Local: Ryzen 7 255, about 44 GiB RAM, RTX 5070 Ti 16 GiB, driver 595.84.
- Remote: RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16 GiB, Ubuntu/WSL; approximately 12 GiB is occupied
  by existing applications. Both rank records retain device/driver metadata.
- Python: `/home/walkerchi/Code/ComfyUI/.venv/bin/python`, Torch 2.11.0+cu128,
  Triton 3.6.0, PyG 2.8.0.post1. `torch_cluster` 1.6.3+pt211cu128 and
  `pyg_lib` 0.9.0+pt211cu128 were installed with `--target` into the isolated
  `/tmp/tiga-paper-v2-deps.AW5KyW`; no service environment was changed.
- Official wheel index: https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.11.0+cu128.html
- `TIGA_OPT=/tmp/tiga-docs-review/compiler/bin/gf-opt` and
  `TIGA_TRANSLATE=/tmp/tiga-docs-review/compiler/bin/gf-translate`; recorded hashes
  match on both hosts. Build from the included source with LLVM/MLIR 22.1.8.
- Native runtime and compiler C-ABI libraries are the existing local build:
  runtime SHA256 `84d646d4cf0826c3a827c5e341c7b331dc2bf01c78026c986b84e88d0482c75e`,
  compiler SHA256 `e912da833a32996194286e5d82d9feb3dad82972fbb82bea21e6ddb77dd294ca`.
  Native libraries were not rebuilt for these experiments.

## Q1: one process per workload / shape / provider

Run from the extracted implementation source. Use a fresh output directory.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=python:.:/path/to/isolated-pyg-dependencies
export TIGA_OPT=/path/to/gf-opt
export TIGA_TRANSLATE=/path/to/gf-translate
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
python -m benchmarks.graph_operations.run_paper_comparison --output /path/to/new-results
```

The formal matrix is `comparison-v2`: 27 successful configurations, four warmups
and ten checked samples per worker. Provider order is seeded and randomized across
the matrix, not interleaved within a worker. Ordinary calls include dispatch and
dynamic coordinate updates. Both dynamic snapshots have complete edge-set checks;
every output is checked. Radius uses binary-grid points and a cutoff between exact
squared-distance levels, with a nontruncating cap verified against full CSR.
kNN uses uniform FP32 points and direct-distance reference selection.

`comparison-commands.json` retains the actual commands and stdout/stderr.
`audit-*.json` are separate two-sample largest-shape native-allocation audits, not
extra timing trials: all three report zero Tiga-native device allocations. The
main memory figures measure Torch live allocated bytes, not reserved memory or
context/module storage. The initial `comparison/` exploratory matrix failed
selected floating-point edge-boundary checks and is excluded entirely; no failed
configuration is relabeled as a passed measurement.

## Q2: preserved 1B sweep plus a bounded diagnostic

The original `data/billion/` archive has its own measured source snapshot, nine
records, ingest commands and independent full-output oracle. Do not rerun the 1B
sweep merely to regenerate a figure. The new profile uses the existing 10M fixture:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=python:.
export TIGA_TENSOR_BACKEND=native
python -m benchmarks.memory_hierarchy.profile_paging \
  --cache-dir /path/to/fixtures --output /path/to/paging-warm.json
nsys profile --trace=cuda --sample=none --cpuctxsw=none \
  --capture-range=cudaProfilerApi --capture-range-end=stop \
  --output=/path/to/paging-trace \
  python -m benchmarks.memory_hierarchy.profile_paging \
  --cache-dir /path/to/fixtures --cuda-capture --evict-fixture \
  --output /path/to/paging-profile.json
nsys stats --report cuda_gpu_kern_sum,cuda_gpu_mem_time_sum,cuda_gpu_mem_size_sum \
  --format csv --output /path/to/paging-cuda /path/to/paging-trace.nsys-rep
```

Nsight Systems 2025.3.2 captures only forward, excluding output validation. The
actual order was eviction-hint+Nsight, then unprofiled warm-page-cache. The profiled
host window excludes profiler start/stop overhead; `forward_s` in its underlying
worker record includes that overhead and must not replace `profile.forward_seconds`.
Exclusive host timers subtract nested intervals. CUDA kernel/copy times are
contained within those host intervals, not additional stacked stages. Process
physical-read bytes include runtime/compiler files, not solely fixture IO.
Only the three fixture files receive eviction hints, not the global OS cache.
These two runs diagnose 10M edges; neither is a 1B time decomposition or a
guaranteed cold-NVMe bandwidth benchmark.

## Q3: two hosts, two topologies, paired critical-path samples

Launch one rank per host with reachable trusted private addresses and matching
source/compiler/NCCL library versions. The actual local deployment commands and
environment are in `distributed-commands.json`. No keys or credentials are stored.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=python:.
export TIGA_TENSOR_BACKEND=native
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=tiga-wg0
export NCCL_SOCKET_FAMILY=AF_INET
export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1
export TIGA_NCCL_LIBRARY=/path/to/matching/libnccl.so.2
python -m benchmarks.distributed.paper_scaling \
  --rank 0 --host PRIVATE_RANK0_IP --port 29732 --transport nccl \
  --sizes 32768,131072,524288 --features 16 --boundary-every 0 \
  --warmup 2 --repeats 5 --output /path/to/local-rank0.json
```

Rank 1 uses identical arguments except rank/output. Repeat with `--boundary-every 4`
and a fresh port/output. Equal contiguous ownership; topology replicated for setup;
runtime source fields owned-only before halo. NCCL 2.28.9 uses Socket over an
existing isolated WireGuard interface with MTU 1200, not RDMA/NVLink. The launcher
restores only that interface when absent; default routes/firewall/services are
unchanged. Formal records are `distributed-final`; initial smoke and exploratory
timing runs are excluded. Every sampled output is fully checked, with input scales
changing. Take max(rank0,rank1) per sample, then median. Host-stage stacks use the
critical rank of the median paired sample so stages sum to its actual duration.
Do not interpret the final stream wait alone as total communication cost.

## Replot and validate

From the paper project:

```bash
python tools/build_three_questions.py --check
python tools/build_three_questions.py
make check
make tectonic
```

Validators check all 27 comparisons, both NCCL ranks/topologies, full output checks,
source/compiler equality, host-phase accounting, native-allocation audits and
archive hashes. Replotting requires no GPU and is not remeasurement. The source
snapshot includes implementation, benchmark drivers and regression tests; compiler
executables and dependency wheels are not embedded.
